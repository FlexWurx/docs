In FlexWurx, you can add your company email (e.g. [name@company.com](mailto:name@company.com)) as a sender, which allows you to send emails, like the resident welcome email, from your company email instead of the default [_hi@flexwurx.com_](mailto:hi@flexwurx.com).

## Step 1: Navigate to the Email Settings

To navigate to email settings:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Click the _Settings_ button at the bottom of your sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Organization Settings">
    Click the _Organization_ button on the settings sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Organization Email Settings">
    Click _Email_ in the navigation bar near the top of the page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You should now be at a page that looks like this:

## ![Email Settings Pn](/images/EmailSettings.png)

## Step 2: Create Sender

To create the sender, first open the Add Sender modal by clicking the _Add Sender_ button.

You should now be on a screen like this:

![Single Sender Modal Pn](/images/SingleSenderModal.png)

Now, fill out the form. Here is an explanation of each item you need to fill out:

- **Nickname:** This is used to identify the sender in the FlexWurx Dashboard. It will never be displayed to recipients. It _must_ be unique.
- **From Email:** This is the email address you would like to verify as a sender and send emails from.
- **From Name:** This is the name associated with the email you are verifying.
- **Address:** This is your current business address. This is needed to comply with CAN-SPAM and CASL.

Once you have filled out the form completely and there are no errors, click _Add Sender_ to add the sender to FlexWurx.

## Step 3: Verify Sender

The final step you need to do is verify your sender. To start this process, you should have recieved an email from [**support@sendgrid.com**](mailto:support@sendgrid.com). That email should look like this:

![Sendgrid Single Sender Verification Email Pn](/images/SendgridSingleSenderVerificationEmail.png)

Where the blackbox is in this image, there should be the email you are attempting to verify.

Go ahead and click the _Verify Sender Identify_ button. That should direct you to this page:

<Warning>
  If you are directed to any other page or asked to enter **any** information once you click that link, DO NOT enter any information and exit the page immediately.
</Warning>

Now, you can go back to the _Organization Email Settings_ page in FlexWurx and reload the page. Once you do, you should see that your sender is verified, as seen below.
